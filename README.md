# Student Performance Prediction Project

## Overview
The Student Performance Prediction Project is a data-driven initiative that employs machine learning and predictive analytics to forecast and enhance the academic performance of students. By leveraging historical student data, including demographic information, past academic records, and various other factors, this project aims to build predictive models capable of forecasting a student's future performance.

## Usage

### 1. Data Input
Input student data, including demographics and past academic records, into the system.

### 2. Run Predictive Models
The predictive models will analyze the input data and generate performance predictions for each student.

### 3. Implement Interventions
Educators and administrators can use the predictions to implement targeted interventions and support for students at risk of underperforming.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes data from Kaggle, providing a diverse and comprehensive dataset for training and testing the predictive models.

### Kaggle Dataset
- [Link to Kaggle Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/your-dataset-link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/schooldata))
  - Include instructions on how to download or access the dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (install using `pip install <library>`):
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library for building predictive models

## Project Structure

### `main.py`
Entry point for the project. Handles input data, runs predictive models, and provides performance predictions.

### `preprocessing.py`
Contains functions for data preprocessing, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

### `models.py`
Implements machine learning models for performance prediction.

### `utils.py`
Includes utility functions used across the project.

### `data/`
Folder containing the Kaggle dataset.

## Configuration
Adjust the parameters in the `config.py` file to fine-tune the behavior of the predictive models.

## Future Improvements
